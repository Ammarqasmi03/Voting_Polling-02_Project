Online Voting & Polling Application

Project Overview

The Online Voting and Polling Application is a full-stack web-based system designed to create, manage, and participate in polls in a simple, secure, and user-friendly manner. This project allows users to create polls with multiple options, vote for their preferred choices, and view poll results in real time. The application demonstrates the practical implementation of modern web technologies by combining a responsive frontend with a robust backend architecture.
This system is useful for surveys, feedback collection, classroom voting, decision-making processes, and opinion polling in organizations or institutions. The project focuses on clean design, scalability, and proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend layers.

Problem Statement

Traditional voting and polling methods are often time-consuming, manual, and error-prone. Collecting responses using paper-based systems or informal methods can lead to inaccuracies, delayed results, and lack of transparency. There is a need for a digital solution that allows polls to be created and votes to be recorded instantly with minimal effort.
The Online Voting and Polling Application solves this problem by providing a centralized, automated platform that ensures accuracy, speed, and ease of use.

Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

-> To develop a web-based polling system using modern technologies

-> To allow users to create polls with multiple voting options

-> To enable real-time voting and instant result updates

-> To store poll and vote data securely in a database

-> To implement a clean API-based architecture

-> To demonstrate full-stack development skills


Key Features

1. Create Polls
Users can create new polls by entering a question and adding multiple options. Each poll is stored securely in the database with its associated options.

2. Vote on Polls
Users can participate in polls by selecting one of the available options. Each vote is counted accurately and stored in the backend.

3. Real-Time Results
Votes are updated dynamically, allowing users to see the current poll results without refreshing the page.

4. User-Friendly Interface
The frontend is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, ensuring smooth navigation and an intuitive user experience.

5. RESTful API Architecture
The backend exposes REST APIs that handle poll creation, voting, and data retrieval efficiently.

6. Database Integration

Polls, options, and votes are persistently stored using a relational database, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
